## Git Conflict Resolve Test

This section is dedicated to testing how to resolve conflicts in Git. Conflicts occur when changes from different branches or commits overlap and Git cannot automatically merge them. To resolve a conflict, you need to manually edit the conflicting files to reconcile the differences, then stage and commit the resolved changes.

- Create a conflict by modifying the same line in a file on two different branches.
- Attempt to merge the branches to trigger a conflict.
- Edit the file to resolve the conflict.
- Stage and commit the resolved file.

By practicing conflict resolution, you can ensure smooth collaboration in your projects.
